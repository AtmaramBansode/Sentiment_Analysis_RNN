This movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties, the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies, but really, if you want that you can rent something from the \\\"Adult\\\" section.

Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes.

He's hard-boiled noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I've ever encountered. There are rarely private detectives in his work - just losers, psychotics and small-time con artists. This film has Thompson nailed - \\\"If God made any real mistakes in this world, it was in giving us a will to live when we've got no excuse for it.\\\" Every character in the film balances on a razor's edge between surreal and creepy realism. There's sleazy, conniving Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and spookily well-intentioned Doc Goldman played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives a wonderful, often heart-wrenching performance as Kid Collins, a none-too-bright, shy ex-fighter who's more scared of himself than of anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, the sexy femme fatale who we can't quite figure out...It's not your standard film noir, nor is it intended to be. After Dark My Sweet, along with The Grifters, are two excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.\",\n          \"Where to even start? The horrendous acting?

I am a lifelong horror fan, and I have no problem at all with the current \\\"torture-thon\\\" trend of movies. However, this is a poorly-made piece of garbage. I think I suffered more pain watching this than the characters did dying in it! If you like girls being forced to eat stir-fried penis, really poor soft core porn and think lines like \\\"I'm gonna find that b**** and staple her c*** shut!!\\\" are clever, LIVE FEED is for you.<br /><br />As for me, I feel the need to go wash my eyes out with oven cleaner to prevent from ever seeing this movie again!\",\n          \"A real sudsy soap opera here as Spencer Tracy tackles the role of an illiterate until the age of 20.

A n'eer-do-well son and a faltering marriage leads to disaster and tragedy. Tracy buys a railroad and succeeds only to be subjected to a disastrous rail strike and the death of 406 workers.<br /><br />The film appeared at the beginning to be uneven but is rejuvenated thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here.<br /><br />A double separate suicide here. We know that riches can't buy happiness but this is a little too far fetched. Nonetheless, we have riveting performances by Tracy and Colleen Moore.

He's hard-boiled noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I've ever encountered. There are rarely private detectives in his work - just losers, psychotics and small-time con artists. This film has Thompson nailed - \\\"If God made any real mistakes in this world, it was in giving us a will to live when we've got no excuse for it.\\\" Every character in the film balances on a razor's edge between surreal and creepy realism. There's sleazy, conniving Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and spookily well-intentioned Doc Goldman played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives a wonderful, often heart-wrenching performance as Kid Collins, a none-too-bright, shy ex-fighter who's more scared of himself than of anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, the sexy femme fatale who we can't quite figure out...It's not your standard film noir, nor is it intended to be. After Dark My Sweet, along with The Grifters, are two excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.\",\n          \"Where to even start? The horrendous acting?

I am a lifelong horror fan, and I have no problem at all with the current \\\"torture-thon\\\" trend of movies. However, this is a poorly-made piece of garbage.

A n'eer-do-well son and a faltering marriage leads to disaster and tragedy. Tracy buys a railroad and succeeds only to be subjected to a disastrous rail strike and the death of 406 workers.<br /><br />The film appeared at the beginning to be uneven but is rejuvenated thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here.<br /><br />A double separate suicide here.

            " b'as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time second only to the breakfast club the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time it s underrated and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people it comes on tbs maybe once a year but sometimes longer the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes then the second half is pure honest and most of the time serious with only a few comic scenes in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time i ve never heard this many great songs in one movie before there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin hes in high school who has a couple of best friends his two friends are sex sarved teens the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures that are very funny gary is major in love with the new girl in school he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her he also cheats on the side you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much you can feel it even more in the second half gary s friend turns out to be a creep but his other friend is pretty cool the movie shows how mean people can be you can relate to a lot of this movie the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy but it s so much more than that it s a very honest movie it s also very 80ish which i love if you love the 80 s or grew up in the 80 s rent this movie but there may be some people that don t like the 80 s but still may like this movie i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think it s very entertaining and very funny it combines very touching moments with very funny moments it s an underrated gem i have the movie i love it i give the last american virgin 1 2 out of'\n",
            " b'maybe it s because i looked up the history of the irish troubles in the 1920s and then the sad civil war that engulfed the free state after the signing of the treaty before watching this movie anyway the sudden turn at the end brought tears to my eyes br br victor mclaglen isn t as famous today as he was back then and he should be better remembered in this film i think he s playing himself as he would have been without his innate talent and brains for example the scenes where his buddy in the crowd is challenging men to fight with him is probably quite reminiscent of what mclaglen actually did in earlier years when he was a world class bare knuckles boxer john ford is partly responsible for that the imdb trivia section shows how he tricked mclaglen into getting a really bad hangover for the trial scene this director also could bring out a lot in his actors even without such tricks mostly though mclaglen is firmly in control especially when his character is almost totally blotto which is difficult for an actor to do believably and he also plays gypo nolan with a depth and emotional power that is surprising for someone who has only seen mclaglen later in his career in the quiet man i especially like the contrast between this role as an ira man and the much more obviously controlled performance he gave as the ira man denis hogan in hangman s house br br in the quiet man of course mclaglen is a country squire at odds with the local ira victor mclaglen was big and bully in the old fashioned sense of the word but he was a good actor too and capable of wide range and fine nuances of performance that we just wouldn t expect of a such a man today it s a rather sad comment on our own set of expectations and prejudices br br ford as usual packs a lot into a little bit of film all the characters are excellent though the commandant s mostly american accent is distracting note there be spoilers ahead knowing that gypo once drew the short straw and was ordered to kill a man but let him talk his way out of it instead we really empathize with the man who draws the short straw for executing gypo and the humanity he shows most notably when they go to take gypo in mary s room br br john ford really shows his genius here taking what could have been a gruesome and yet expected outcome to the whole story and instead using it to set up a totally unexpected and yet very satisfying ending that makes us think not just of gypo and the other characters but of poor ireland during that tortured time'\n",

            " b'you don t need to read this review br br an earlier review by pninson of seattle has already identified all the main shortcomings of this production i can only amplify its basic arguments br br bleak house was a relatively late dickens novel and is much darker than his earlier work this is taken too literally by the director ross devenish who piles on the gloom and fog too much when ada rick and esther appear half an hour into the opening episode it is a relief just to be in daylight for the first time in some of the murkier scenes it was hard to see what was actually on my tv screen i watched the whole thing in one day starting in mid afternoon as daylight faded this became less of an issue but i have a pretty good tv and i have never encountered this problem before at any time of day br br the pacing is very deliberate i e slow i am sure this was intensional but it is overdone there are numerous shots of people trudging though the muck and gloom of victorian london that are held longer than is necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere a good editor could probably take several minutes out of each fifty minute episode without losing a line of dialogue just by trimming each of these scenes slightly br br i don t want to overstate these two problems you soon adjust to the look and pace of this production the more important issue is that it doesn t always tell the story very effectively earlier dickens novels are as long as bleak house but are not nearly so intricately plotted for example i recently re read nicholas nickleby because i was intrigued to see how douglas mcgrath crammed an 800 page book into his two hour movie the answer is simple the book is full of padding mcgrath cut great swathes of the novel while still retaining all the essential story elements this would not be possible with bleak house br br this production needs its seven hours probably it needs even longer because many elements of its convoluted plot are not sufficiently clear or as well handled as they need to be a few random examples will illustrate the problems br br the maid rosa appears from nowhere with no background so lady dedlock s attachment to her is largely unmotivated br br sergeant george s acquiescence in tulkinhorn s demand for a sample of horton s handwriting is somewhat fudged br br it is not made clear enough that esther is actually in love with woodcourt when she agrees to marry john jarndyce neither is it clear that they have agreed not to announce their engagement or why br br ada and rick s secret marriage is omitted in one episode they are merely lovers in the next people are suddenly referring to them as husband and wife br br mrs rouncewell is only introduced at a late stage in the story and sargeant george s estrangement from his family is left unexplained as is the means by which she is discovered br br tulkinhorn s dedication to maintaining the honour and respectability of the dedlock family is understated so his motive for persecuting lady dedlock is more obscure than it need be br br the involvement of the brick makers with both tom and later lady dedlock is somewhat opaque br br it is not obvious that guppy renews his offer to esther because her smallpox scars have all but vanished br br this is only a selection there are others they are not major problems and the main thrust of the story is clear enough nonetheless they are minor irritations that detract from its power you shouldn t have to puzzle over little plot points however there are more important structural problems that do weaken the story in its later stages br br the whole business of tulkinhorn s murder is somewhat thrown away bucket immediately pinpoints hortense as a suspect which undermines the suspense of sergeant george s predicament and the importance of finding mrs rouncewell it also diminishes the impact of the sub plot in which suspicion is thrown on lady dedlock and weakens the scene in which hortense is unmasked in front of sir lester br br a more serious problem is that the murder its investigation and the subsequent search for lady dedlock dominate the story for over an hour during which time we completely lose sight of the other main plot strand the legal case and its effect on rick his failing finances his gouging by vholes and skimpole ada s despair his declining health and so on are all put on hold for an entire episode this may be how dickens wrote the book i haven t read it for years but a good screenplay should keep the different plot strands moving forward together br br finally smallweed s role in the story is so diminished that he is almost superfluous his discovery of the new will that triggers the final phase of the story is also thrown away it happens off screen br br despite all of this it is still a very good production many of the performances are outstanding individual scenes are beautifully realised its accumulating sense of tragedy is very powerful i would still be recommending it as a superb adaptation of a great book had it not been for the 2005 production in fact i probably wouldn t be fully aware of its defects if i hadn t seen how andrew davies did it better i have been critical of davies s jane austen adaptations but i have to admit that he really knows how to tame dickens s sprawling books br br this is an impressive and gripping drama and well worth seven hours of anybody s time nonetheless its probable fate is to be viewed mainly as a cross reference to the near definitive 2005 version'\n",

            " b'i saw sea of dust as part of a nyc screening audience several years ago i enjoyed the film at that time so i was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since perhaps it s my memory but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the rhode island film festival i m really not sure which version i prefer but i can honestly say that i found something to appreciate it both br br let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie although it s been promoted as a hammer films tribute people expecting a showdown between van helsing and dracula are going to be sorely disappointed there s some cleavage but no nudity a staple of the british production house s later movies and while sea of dust is filled with gorgeous eye candy it really is shot like a sixties film and features hammer starlet ingrid pitt it s not like any of the company s pictures in tone or execution this film is very dark very confusing and at times very funny i don t remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one but that s not a bad thing especially the showdown in the black forest that plays like a three stooges short and some of ms pitt s rantings are quite entertaining it s like somebody wound her up and turned her loose br br the uniqueness of this film doesn t lie with the borrowed details though it s in the ideas as an occasional sci fi channel viewer i ve regularly taken the network to task for its one note variations on a theme cgi monster kills then gets destroyed sea of dust is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while br br but don t get me wrong i m not complaining if anything i applaud these guys for making such an enterprising low budget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts it s not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies you know who you are but for the rest of us those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films the predictability the lack of respect for the audience this may just be your ticket'\n",
            " b'if you have sons or daughters who love action adventure intrigue and imagination without the need to break into song every twelve minutes then this is the disney movie for you my sons loved every minute of this film and i have to admit that i laughed out loud many times throughout the movie there are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story and the characters are all lovable and identifiable in their own right this should go down as one of the disney classics because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non stop excitement'\n",
            " b'i have seen over 2000 studio era sound films including lots of judy garland lena horne shirley jones and deanna durbin s own universal features plus a decent amount of live and studio recorded musical comedy and opera and i assure you no one tasked with singing in front of a camera and microphone or maybe anywhere ever has ever touched durbin s solo here mono soundtrack and crap 1930s microphones and all the kid from canada sings this bit from il bacio like she lived and wrote it herself and then happened to show up for a retrospective in italy late in her career not like a child who learned it from her music teacher br br if you skip this extra on the dvd or skip ahead to the garland solo you are just depriving yourself since this cheap mgm teaser just happened to capture one of the greatest performances of the 20c']\n",

I made it about 50 minutes into it and started skipping chapters until the end. The plot is nothing special, and the dialog from the movie deviates from the main story so much that your head will explode out of rage. Many useless minutes wasted just listening to characters jabber on about something irrelevant to the plot, AND/OR something that could said in a shorter amount of time. The camera work is shaky, and grainy. It seemed Mr. Milligan needed to take his finger off of the zoom button! I noticed also that at some points during this movie it seemed that Andy was having seizures, and would uncontrollably shake the camera. The splices between scenes were jumpy and didn't flow. The murder scenes were nothing special - incredibly, and laughably fake. Barely any gore, as the title suggests. This movie runs about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murder scenes take up about 1 minute TOTAL of the whole movie - if that. What a wretched piece of garbage this movie was. Andy Milligan is in fact probably one of the worst directors to plague mankind with his talentless directing, and camera-work. Usually, I can make it through really bad horror movies, and laugh about it later. BLOODTHIRSTY BUTCHERS, however, I can't. I am just angry I wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this (what I wouldn't do to gain it back). Take my suggestion, and DO NOT see this movie unless you plan on falling asleep. TERRIBLE.\",\n          \"She's not Michael Jordan<br /><br />Think of all the marvelous NBA players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth. Their names might trip as easily off the public's lips as Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, the list goes on; but the volume gets turned down a little, for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to Michael.<br /><br />I've seen it written that Gretchen Mol's career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 Vanity Fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for Ms. Mol. It was later said that she had been over hyped. I disagree.<br /><br />I still remember that for some time after I saw \\\"The Devil's Advocate\\\" in '97 or '98, I would get confused as to which actress played Mary Ann Lomax. Was it Mol or Theron? Oh yeah! Charlize Theron was the one in \\\"2 Days in the Valley\\\" and \\\"Mighty Joe Young\\\" and Gretchen Mol was in \\\"Donnie Brasco\\\", \\\"Celebrity\\\", and \\\"Rounders\\\".<br /><br />By the time I had seen \\\"The Thirteenth Floor\\\" (Mol) and \\\"Sweet November\\\" (Theron), I pretty much had them straightened out but I still put them in the same mental file drawer. Both were highly talented, had sweet faces, similar body types, short blonde hair and so on.<br /><br />Theron, though, was offered more work. I loved her as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating.<br /><br />In 2003 \\\"Monster\\\" was released and from that point until the handing of the Oscar itself, all of filmdom knew who the \\\"Best Actress\\\" award was going to. And deservedly so! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. The only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real Aileen Wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in Selby's head. And for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive! Unheard of!<br /><br />Then in 2005 \\\"The Notorious Bettie Page\\\" was released. Mol's performance was extraordinary. Maybe she was standing in the shadow of Ms. Theron. It was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing Presidential candidate, nobody came and nobody cared. It was viewed as a continuation of an old tale, once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a \\\"B\\\" movie. Ho hum! No, no, no! Wrong! No matter what you may think of the film (and I enjoy films about the fifties) if you pass on this one you'll be missing one of the better performances of that year. Ms. Moll was every bit as much Bettie as Ms. Theron was Aileen. Unfortunately Aileen, to the film-going public, is the more sympathetic character. For whatever reason, an amoral, sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a na\\u00efve, unsophisticated, uninhibited, religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties. Her photos and films never sexual, never pornographic, but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky. There was no sense of realism, only parody. Ms. Moll captured the very essence of the character. She gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film, her body was Bettie's. Her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about Bettie. Cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality. In this film it's all about innocence. Seeing Gretchen/Bettie nude didn't make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other. If you pass on this film you'll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years. By the way, shame on the MPAA for giving this an R rating.\",\n          \"Oh, where the hell should I begin? Give a brief summary of the story? No. either you've already heard it, or don't want to. Either way, it sucks. Much like the movie. I happen to be a semi-large horror movie aficionado, and I must say this is one of the dumbest and most clumsily-executed movies I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. <br /><br />The script is horrendously stupid. The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest. All of those torture scenes would have been A LOT more effective if we gave even the tiniest bit of crap for the characters. Since the first scene in the film is when the teenage girls meet Capt. Howdy, how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them? First off, they seem stupid for going to a party with a guy they don't even know, and second, we don't even know their damn names! Why the hell should I care if they live or die? Not to mention the fact that they actually have the guts to try and make us feel sympathetic towards Capt. Howdy after he's been \\\"reformed\\\"? PLEASE! I was cheering when he got his just deserts! He deserved them! Hell, he deserved worse! Also, we're forced to sit through a pointless misdirect sequence lifted directly from \\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\\" (and here it's done HORRIBLY! Of course he's gonna give them a false address! And even if he had given them the real one, don't you think he'd be waiting and not piercing some guy's Johnson upstairs? RETARDED!)<br /><br />Then there's the dialogue. Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid. \\\"The dead are so dreadfully dead, when they're dead\\\"?? What the hell kind of crap is that?! Dee Snider at one point says \\\"knowledge is power\\\". Well, if that's true, this film has absolutely no power whatsoever. <br /><br />Then, there's the plot holes. Yes, I know this is a horror film (well, wannabe horror film), but damn! You could drive a semi truck into these holes! First off, these have got to be the DUMBEST cops I have EVER SEEN! EVER!! I mean, DEAR GOD, these guys are morons! Call for backup, idiots! Second, how the hell did that humungous septum ring fall out of Captain Howdy's nose?! Evidentially this piercing expert guy says \\\"that's the biggest one I've ever seen\\\", but if it's so damn big, how the hell could it have fallen out so easily? Did Capt. Howdy just LEAVE it at the crime scene because he WANTED to get caught? They sure didn't make it seem like he did. Also, they would NEVER release Capt. Howdy, and I know that for a damn fact. He would be in jail for the rest of his life, and there's no getting around this. Much less let him return to his old house where he killed/tortured everybody. IMPOSSIBLE AND IMPLAUSIBLE. <br /><br />And now the acting. Dear God did these people suck. Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film. She's poised and amazing. Too bad she hardly gets a good chance to act in this piece of crap. Amy Smart shows up for about 10 minutes and then drops out of existence. Even the usually entertaining Robert Englund is underused and ineffective here. Dee Snider plays the crazy guy with no talent whatsoever. I never felt threatened, scared or intimidated. I'd rather have seen Dee Snider in Alexis Arquette's role in \\\"Bride of Chucky\\\". It would have been so much more fun to see this talent-less hack get it by that lovable psycho doll. <br /><br />Dee Snider just plain sucks. He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?), and he's obviously dumber than freaking Jessica Simpson! This film is just a way for Dee Snider to show off all the weird crap he knows about self-mutilation and modern primitives and blah-blah-blah. Either it's been done before or it just didn't need to be done. I was bored throughout the whole damn thing. <br /><br />The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks. This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably. It doesn't manage to scare, shock, or disturb in any shape, way or form. This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life. A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid. <br /><br />\\\"Strangeland\\\" gets a 0 out of 10. Avoid at any and all costs. Not enjoyable in the slightest.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

also that at some points during this movie it seemed that andy was having seizures and would uncontrollably shake the camera the splices between scenes were jumpy and didn t flow the murder scenes were nothing special incredibly and laughably fake barely any gore as the title suggests this movie runs about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murder scenes take up about 1 minute total of the whole movie if that what a wretched piece of garbage this movie was andy milligan is in fact probably one of the worst directors to plague mankind with his talentless directing and camera work usually i can make it through really bad horror movies and laugh about it later bloodthirsty butchers however i can t i am just angry i wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this what i wouldn t do to gain it back take my suggestion and do not see this movie unless you plan on falling asleep terrible\",\n          \"she s not michael jordan br br think of all the marvelous nba players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth their names might trip as easily off the public s lips as russell cousy byrd magic mchale oscar wilt the list goes on but the volume gets turned down a little for stockton and malone charles patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to michael br br i ve seen it written that gretchen mol s career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 vanity fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for ms mol it was later said that she had been over hyped i disagree br br i still remember that for some time after i saw the devil s advocate in 97 or 98 i would get confused as to which actress played mary ann lomax was it mol or theron oh yeah charlize theron was the one in 2 days in the valley and mighty joe young and gretchen mol was in donnie brasco celebrity and rounders br br by the time i had seen the thirteenth floor mol and sweet november theron i pretty much had them straightened out but i still put them in the same mental file drawer both were highly talented had sweet faces similar body types short blonde hair and so on br br theron though was offered more work i loved her as sara deever and as adele invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating br br in 2003 monster was released and from that point until the handing of the oscar itself all of filmdom knew who the best actress award was going to and deservedly so theron was aileen wuornos the only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real aileen wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in selby s head and for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive unheard of br br then in 2005 the notorious bettie page was released mol s performance was extraordinary maybe she was standing in the shadow of ms theron it was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing presidential candidate nobody came and nobody cared it was viewed as a continuation of an old tale once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a b movie ho hum no no no wrong no matter what you may think of the film and i enjoy films about the fifties if you pass on this one you ll be missing one of the better performances of that year ms moll was every bit as much bettie as ms theron was aileen unfortunately aileen to the film going public is the more sympathetic character for whatever reason an amoral sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a na ve unsophisticated uninhibited religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed bettie page was one of the icons of the fifties her photos and films never sexual never pornographic but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky there was no sense of realism only parody ms moll captured the very essence of the character she gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film her body was bettie s her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about bettie cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality in this film it s all about innocence seeing gretchen bettie nude didn t make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other if you pass on this film you ll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years by the way shame on the mpaa for giving this an r rating\",\n          \"oh where the hell should i begin give a brief summary of the story no either you ve already heard it or don t want to either way it sucks much like the movie i happen to be a semi large horror movie aficionado and i must say this is one of the dumbest and most clumsily executed movies i ve ever had the displeasure of viewing br br the script is horrendously stupid the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest all of those torture scenes would have been a lot more effective if we gave even the tiniest bit of crap for the characters since the first scene in the film is when the teenage girls meet capt howdy how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them first off they seem stupid for going to a party with a guy they don t even know and second we don t even know their damn names why the hell should i care if they live or die not to mention the fact that they actually have the guts to try and make us feel sympathetic towards capt howdy after he s been reformed please i was cheering when he got his just deserts he deserved them hell he deserved worse also we re forced to sit through a pointless misdirect sequence lifted directly from the silence of the lambs and here it s done horribly of course he s gonna give them a false address and even if he had given them the real one don t you think he d be waiting and not piercing some guy s johnson upstairs retarded br br then there s the dialogue everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid the dead are so dreadfully dead when they re dead what the hell kind of crap is that dee snider at one point says knowledge is power well if that s true this film has absolutely no power whatsoever br br then there s the plot holes yes i know this is a horror film well wannabe horror film but damn you could drive a semi truck into these holes first off these have got to be the dumbest cops i have ever seen ever i mean dear god these guys are morons call for backup idiots second how the hell did that humungous septum ring fall out of captain howdy s nose evidentially this piercing expert guy says that s the biggest one i ve ever seen but if it s so damn big how the hell could it have fallen out so easily did capt howdy just leave it at the crime scene because he wanted to get caught they sure didn t make it seem like he did also they would never release capt howdy and i know that for a damn fact he would be in jail for the rest of his life and there s no getting around this much less let him return to his old house where he killed tortured everybody impossible and implausible br br and now the acting dear god did these people suck linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film she s poised and amazing too bad she hardly gets a good chance to act in this piece of crap amy smart shows up for about 10 minutes and then drops out of existence even the usually entertaining robert englund is underused and ineffective here dee snider plays the crazy guy with no talent whatsoever i never felt threatened scared or intimidated i d rather have seen dee snider in alexis arquette s role in bride of chucky it would have been so much more fun to see this talent less hack get it by that lovable psycho doll br br dee snider just plain sucks he can t act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he can t write did he write this damn movie in his sleep and he s obviously dumber than freaking jessica simpson this film is just a way for dee snider to show off all the weird crap he knows about self mutilation and modern primitives and blah blah blah either it s been done before or it just didn t need to be done i was bored throughout the whole damn thing br br the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller horror flick and it fails miserably it doesn t manage to scare shock or disturb in any shape way or form this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid br br strangeland gets a 0 out of 10 avoid at any and all costs not enjoyable in the slightest\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

            " b'office work especially in this era of computers multi functional copy machines e mail voice mail snail mail and temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers and office space and very successfully this latest addition to the temp humor pool however haiku tunnel directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to it s predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar br br as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franc l isco it s an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn t all that funny br br kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp it s a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position he s nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he s typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he s been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are important letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesn t take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluth s days as the fair haired boy are going to be over and quick br br the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh but they didn t and the audience won t because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case plays funny as in he knows he s being funny he never is and that s exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie br br in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn t work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily bad is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it s easy to understand why this one just doesn t fly br br the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project br br shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth s performance if only momentarily but it s still not enough to save the day or the film br br the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone s comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right

            " b'once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent reuniting with some former co stars to clean up the town br br low key often to the point of blandness action comedy mostly just doesn t work part of the problem is the casting chris klien as a former action hero he s not bad but he s really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy as i said he s not bad he s just just miscast for what his back story is the real problem here is the combination of the script which really isn t funny and seems artificial at times and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness there is no life in the way things are set up its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list it makes for an un engaging film and yet the film occasionally springs to life such as the in the final show down that ends the film that sequence works but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power br br i can t really recommend the film its worth a shot if you re a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms but otherwise this is just a disappointment'\n",
            " b'this film is just a shame orlando florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area like vancouver s rise to prominance the brothers was shot in central florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area which made great strides with the indie film walking across africa and the great hbo miniseries from earth to the moon br br i will try to be as honest as possible i think orlando was the perfect place to film the brothers it had the potential to give a new spin on the boy band craze after all both n sync and the backstreet boys come from this area but the brothers falls short probably because of a weak script both lead characters are flat with almost no development part of this could be the amatuer actors but some of it is certainly the way the script was written br br also a problem is the choice of jokes many of the jokes are too repetitive they do come off funny the first time but it does grow to be a bit boring some of the concert scenes are staged poorly and many of these scenes also don t seem to move the story along in any way br br i had high hopes for this one but alas its a disappointing effort i also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short but i think the best thing for filmmaker john figg is to move to different genres quickly comedy isn t his strong suit but its indisputable that he definitely is one of the more prominant filmmakers in the orlando area its just a shame that right now he s infamous not famous br br'\n",

            " b'comedy central has a habit of putting on great programs at times chappelle s show the daily show colbert report and then there are those that some people love or hate stella dr katz then there are some shows that have their defenders but are just plain awful mencia and now sarah silverman br br this show is based on the fact silverman is self centered which can be funny colbert report but can be horrible mind of mencia it should shock no one that i believe the latter is the case this show is a parody of a sitcom and society a program so absurd it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply isn t funny a woman farting has been done in comedy many many times because its not something that s common we don t need 25 minutes of it when a criminal is disarmed by a queef it simply loses its appeal we saw it in jay and silent bob strike back except the women were hotter and the whole scene was more absurd making it better but the best comparison of this show is to stella except stella was more subtle which is what made the absurdist comedy funny it had better acting and i suppose a bit more of a fantastical realist view br br perhaps the fact some reviews are so negative i m very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not dispute fan reaction to this show is the amount of advertising on it very obnoxious ads through many programs far outdo advertising on for other programs many people are wondering why sarah silverman has a career and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled this show should ve never made it past the unaired pilot stage back to norm showed far more promise yet this show makes it further and as far as critics being correct many things have been universally panned have seen their status rise immensely last i checked britney spears gets good reviews too also take that comparison however you want because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychotic on imdb for not liking this show'\n",

special and the dialog from the movie deviates from the main story so much that your head will explode out of rage many useless minutes wasted just listening to characters jabber on about something irrelevant to the plot and or something that could said in a shorter amount of time the camera work is shaky and grainy it seemed mr milligan needed to take his finger off of the zoom button i noticed also that at some points during this movie it seemed that andy was having seizures and would uncontrollably shake the camera the splices between scenes were jumpy and didn t flow the murder scenes were nothing special incredibly and laughably fake barely any gore as the title suggests this movie runs about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murder scenes take up about 1 minute total of the whole movie if that what a wretched piece of garbage this movie was andy milligan is in fact probably one of the worst directors to plague mankind with his talentless directing and camera work usually i can make it through really bad horror movies and laugh about it later bloodthirsty butchers however i can t i am just angry i wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this what i wouldn t do to gain it back take my suggestion and do not see this movie unless you plan on falling asleep terrible\",\n          \"she s not michael jordan br br think of all the marvelous nba players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth their names might trip as easily off the public s lips as russell cousy byrd magic mchale oscar wilt the list goes on but the volume gets turned down a little for stockton and malone charles patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to michael br br i ve seen it written that gretchen mol s career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 vanity fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for ms mol it was later said that she had been over hyped i disagree br br i still remember that for some time after i saw the devil s advocate in 97 or 98 i would get confused as to which actress played mary ann lomax was it mol or theron oh yeah charlize theron was the one in 2 days in the valley and mighty joe young and gretchen mol was in donnie brasco celebrity and rounders br br by the time i had seen the thirteenth floor mol and sweet november theron i pretty much had them straightened out but i still put them in the same mental file drawer both were highly talented had sweet faces similar body types short blonde hair and so on br br theron though was offered more work i loved her as sara deever and as adele invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating br br in 2003 monster was released and from that point until the handing of the oscar itself all of filmdom knew who the best actress award was going to and deservedly so theron was aileen wuornos the only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real aileen wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in selby s head and for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive unheard of br br then in 2005 the notorious bettie page was released mol s performance was extraordinary maybe she was standing in the shadow of ms theron it was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing presidential candidate nobody came and nobody cared it was viewed as a continuation of an old tale once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a b movie ho hum no no no wrong no matter what you may think of the film and i enjoy films about the fifties if you pass on this one you ll be missing one of the better performances of that year ms moll was every bit as much bettie as ms theron was aileen unfortunately aileen to the film going public is the more sympathetic character for whatever reason an amoral sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a na ve unsophisticated uninhibited religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed bettie page was one of the icons of the fifties her photos and films never sexual never pornographic but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky there was no sense of realism only parody ms moll captured the very essence of the character she gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film her body was bettie s her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about bettie cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality in this film it s all about innocence seeing gretchen bettie nude didn t make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other if you pass on this film you ll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years by the way shame on the mpaa for giving this an r rating\",\n          \"oh where the hell should i begin give a brief summary of the story no either you ve already heard it or don t want to either way it sucks much like the movie i happen to be a semi large horror movie aficionado and i must say this is one of the dumbest and most clumsily executed movies i ve ever had the displeasure of viewing br br the script is horrendously stupid the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest all of those torture scenes would have been a lot more effective if we gave even the tiniest bit of crap for the characters since the first scene in the film is when the teenage girls meet capt howdy how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them first off they seem stupid for going to a party with a guy they don t even know and second we don t even know their damn names why the hell should i care if they live or die not to mention the fact that they actually have the guts to try and make us feel sympathetic towards capt howdy after he s been reformed please i was cheering when he got his just deserts he deserved them hell he deserved worse also we re forced to sit through a pointless misdirect sequence lifted directly from the silence of the lambs and here it s done horribly of course he s gonna give them a false address and even if he had given them the real one don t you think he d be waiting and not piercing some guy s johnson upstairs retarded br br then there s the dialogue everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid the dead are so dreadfully dead when they re dead what the hell kind of crap is that dee snider at one point says knowledge is power well if that s true this film has absolutely no power whatsoever br br then there s the plot holes yes i know this is a horror film well wannabe horror film but damn you could drive a semi truck into these holes first off these have got to be the dumbest cops i have ever seen ever i mean dear god these guys are morons call for backup idiots second how the hell did that humungous septum ring fall out of captain howdy s nose evidentially this piercing expert guy says that s the biggest one i ve ever seen but if it s so damn big how the hell could it have fallen out so easily did capt howdy just leave it at the crime scene because he wanted to get caught they sure didn t make it seem like he did also they would never release capt howdy and i know that for a damn fact he would be in jail for the rest of his life and there s no getting around this much less let him return to his old house where he killed tortured everybody impossible and implausible br br and now the acting dear god did these people suck linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film she s poised and amazing too bad she hardly gets a good chance to act in this piece of crap amy smart shows up for about 10 minutes and then drops out of existence even the usually entertaining robert englund is underused and ineffective here dee snider plays the crazy guy with no talent whatsoever i never felt threatened scared or intimidated i d rather have seen dee snider in alexis arquette s role in bride of chucky it would have been so much more fun to see this talent less hack get it by that lovable psycho doll br br dee snider just plain sucks he can t act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he can t write did he write this damn movie in his sleep and he s obviously dumber than freaking jessica simpson this film is just a way for dee snider to show off all the weird crap he knows about self mutilation and modern primitives and blah blah blah either it s been done before or it just didn t need to be done i was bored throughout the whole damn thing br br the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller horror flick and it fails miserably it doesn t manage to scare shock or disturb in any shape way or form this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid br br strangeland gets a 0 out of 10 avoid at any and all costs not enjoyable in the slightest\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

special and the dialog from the movie deviates from the main story so much that your head will explode out of rage many useless minutes wasted just listening to characters jabber on about something irrelevant to the plot and or something that could said in a shorter amount of time the camera work is shaky and grainy it seemed mr milligan needed to take his finger off of the zoom button i noticed also that at some points during this movie it seemed that andy was having seizures and would uncontrollably shake the camera the splices between scenes were jumpy and didn t flow the murder scenes were nothing special incredibly and laughably fake barely any gore as the title suggests this movie runs about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murder scenes take up about 1 minute total of the whole movie if that what a wretched piece of garbage this movie was andy milligan is in fact probably one of the worst directors to plague mankind with his talentless directing and camera work usually i can make it through really bad horror movies and laugh about it later bloodthirsty butchers however i can t i am just angry i wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this what i wouldn t do to gain it back take my suggestion and do not see this movie unless you plan on falling asleep terrible\",\n          \"she s not michael jordan br br think of all the marvelous nba players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth their names might trip as easily off the public s lips as russell cousy byrd magic mchale oscar wilt the list goes on but the volume gets turned down a little for stockton and malone charles patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to michael br br i ve seen it written that gretchen mol s career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 vanity fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for ms mol it was later said that she had been over hyped i disagree br br i still remember that for some time after i saw the devil s advocate in 97 or 98 i would get confused as to which actress played mary ann lomax was it mol or theron oh yeah charlize theron was the one in 2 days in the valley and mighty joe young and gretchen mol was in donnie brasco celebrity and rounders br br by the time i had seen the thirteenth floor mol and sweet november theron i pretty much had them straightened out but i still put them in the same mental file drawer both were highly talented had sweet faces similar body types short blonde hair and so on br br theron though was offered more work i loved her as sara deever and as adele invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating br br in 2003 monster was released and from that point until the handing of the oscar itself all of filmdom knew who the best actress award was going to and deservedly so theron was aileen wuornos the only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real aileen wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in selby s head and for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive unheard of br br then in 2005 the notorious bettie page was released mol s performance was extraordinary maybe she was standing in the shadow of ms theron it was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing presidential candidate nobody came and nobody cared it was viewed as a continuation of an old tale once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a b movie ho hum no no no wrong no matter what you may think of the film and i enjoy films about the fifties if you pass on this one you ll be missing one of the better performances of that year ms moll was every bit as much bettie as ms theron was aileen unfortunately aileen to the film going public is the more sympathetic character for whatever reason an amoral sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a na ve unsophisticated uninhibited religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed bettie page was one of the icons of the fifties her photos and films never sexual never pornographic but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky there was no sense of realism only parody ms moll captured the very essence of the character she gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film her body was bettie s her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about bettie cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality in this film it s all about innocence seeing gretchen bettie nude didn t make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other if you pass on this film you ll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years by the way shame on the mpaa for giving this an r rating\",\n          \"oh where the hell should i begin give a brief summary of the story no either you ve already heard it or don t want to either way it sucks much like the movie i happen to be a semi large horror movie aficionado and i must say this is one of the dumbest and most clumsily executed movies i ve ever had the displeasure of viewing br br the script is horrendously stupid the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest all of those torture scenes would have been a lot more effective if we gave even the tiniest bit of crap for the characters since the first scene in the film is when the teenage girls meet capt howdy how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them first off they seem stupid for going to a party with a guy they don t even know and second we don t even know their damn names why the hell should i care if they live or die not to mention the fact that they actually have the guts to try and make us feel sympathetic towards capt howdy after he s been reformed please i was cheering when he got his just deserts he deserved them hell he deserved worse also we re forced to sit through a pointless misdirect sequence lifted directly from the silence of the lambs and here it s done horribly of course he s gonna give them a false address and even if he had given them the real one don t you think he d be waiting and not piercing some guy s johnson upstairs retarded br br then there s the dialogue everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid the dead are so dreadfully dead when they re dead what the hell kind of crap is that dee snider at one point says knowledge is power well if that s true this film has absolutely no power whatsoever br br then there s the plot holes yes i know this is a horror film well wannabe horror film but damn you could drive a semi truck into these holes first off these have got to be the dumbest cops i have ever seen ever i mean dear god these guys are morons call for backup idiots second how the hell did that humungous septum ring fall out of captain howdy s nose evidentially this piercing expert guy says that s the biggest one i ve ever seen but if it s so damn big how the hell could it have fallen out so easily did capt howdy just leave it at the crime scene because he wanted to get caught they sure didn t make it seem like he did also they would never release capt howdy and i know that for a damn fact he would be in jail for the rest of his life and there s no getting around this much less let him return to his old house where he killed tortured everybody impossible and implausible br br and now the acting dear god did these people suck linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film she s poised and amazing too bad she hardly gets a good chance to act in this piece of crap amy smart shows up for about 10 minutes and then drops out of existence even the usually entertaining robert englund is underused and ineffective here dee snider plays the crazy guy with no talent whatsoever i never felt threatened scared or intimidated i d rather have seen dee snider in alexis arquette s role in bride of chucky it would have been so much more fun to see this talent less hack get it by that lovable psycho doll br br dee snider just plain sucks he can t act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he can t write did he write this damn movie in his sleep and he s obviously dumber than freaking jessica simpson this film is just a way for dee snider to show off all the weird crap he knows about self mutilation and modern primitives and blah blah blah either it s been done before or it just didn t need to be done i was bored throughout the whole damn thing br br the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller horror flick and it fails miserably it doesn t manage to scare shock or disturb in any shape way or form this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid br br strangeland gets a 0 out of 10 avoid at any and all costs not enjoyable in the slightest\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

special and the dialog from the movie deviates from the main story so much that your head will explode out of rage many useless minutes wasted just listening to characters jabber on about something irrelevant to the plot and or something that could said in a shorter amount of time the camera work is shaky and grainy it seemed mr milligan needed to take his finger off of the zoom button i noticed also that at some points during this movie it seemed that andy was having seizures and would uncontrollably shake the camera the splices between scenes were jumpy and didn t flow the murder scenes were nothing special incredibly and laughably fake barely any gore as the title suggests this movie runs about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murder scenes take up about 1 minute total of the whole movie if that what a wretched piece of garbage this movie was andy milligan is in fact probably one of the worst directors to plague mankind with his talentless directing and camera work usually i can make it through really bad horror movies and laugh about it later bloodthirsty butchers however i can t i am just angry i wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this what i wouldn t do to gain it back take my suggestion and do not see this movie unless you plan on falling asleep terrible\",\n          \"she s not michael jordan br br think of all the marvelous nba players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth their names might trip as easily off the public s lips as russell cousy byrd magic mchale oscar wilt the list goes on but the volume gets turned down a little for stockton and malone charles patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to michael br br i ve seen it written that gretchen mol s career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 vanity fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for ms mol it was later said that she had been over hyped i disagree br br i still remember that for some time after i saw the devil s advocate in 97 or 98 i would get confused as to which actress played mary ann lomax was it mol or theron oh yeah charlize theron was the one in 2 days in the valley and mighty joe young and gretchen mol was in donnie brasco celebrity and rounders br br by the time i had seen the thirteenth floor mol and sweet november theron i pretty much had them straightened out but i still put them in the same mental file drawer both were highly talented had sweet faces similar body types short blonde hair and so on br br theron though was offered more work i loved her as sara deever and as adele invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating br br in 2003 monster was released and from that point until the handing of the oscar itself all of filmdom knew who the best actress award was going to and deservedly so theron was aileen wuornos the only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real aileen wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in selby s head and for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive unheard of br br then in 2005 the notorious bettie page was released mol s performance was extraordinary maybe she was standing in the shadow of ms theron it was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing presidential candidate nobody came and nobody cared it was viewed as a continuation of an old tale once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a b movie ho hum no no no wrong no matter what you may think of the film and i enjoy films about the fifties if you pass on this one you ll be missing one of the better performances of that year ms moll was every bit as much bettie as ms theron was aileen unfortunately aileen to the film going public is the more sympathetic character for whatever reason an amoral sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a na ve unsophisticated uninhibited religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed bettie page was one of the icons of the fifties her photos and films never sexual never pornographic but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky there was no sense of realism only parody ms moll captured the very essence of the character she gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film her body was bettie s her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about bettie cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality in this film it s all about innocence seeing gretchen bettie nude didn t make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other if you pass on this film you ll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years by the way shame on the mpaa for giving this an r rating\",\n          \"oh where the hell should i begin give a brief summary of the story no either you ve already heard it or don t want to either way it sucks much like the movie i happen to be a semi large horror movie aficionado and i must say this is one of the dumbest and most clumsily executed movies i ve ever had the displeasure of viewing br br the script is horrendously stupid the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest all of those torture scenes would have been a lot more effective if we gave even the tiniest bit of crap for the characters since the first scene in the film is when the teenage girls meet capt howdy how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them first off they seem stupid for going to a party with a guy they don t even know and second we don t even know their damn names why the hell should i care if they live or die not to mention the fact that they actually have the guts to try and make us feel sympathetic towards capt howdy after he s been reformed please i was cheering when he got his just deserts he deserved them hell he deserved worse also we re forced to sit through a pointless misdirect sequence lifted directly from the silence of the lambs and here it s done horribly of course he s gonna give them a false address and even if he had given them the real one don t you think he d be waiting and not piercing some guy s johnson upstairs retarded br br then there s the dialogue everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid the dead are so dreadfully dead when they re dead what the hell kind of crap is that dee snider at one point says knowledge is power well if that s true this film has absolutely no power whatsoever br br then there s the plot holes yes i know this is a horror film well wannabe horror film but damn you could drive a semi truck into these holes first off these have got to be the dumbest cops i have ever seen ever i mean dear god these guys are morons call for backup idiots second how the hell did that humungous septum ring fall out of captain howdy s nose evidentially this piercing expert guy says that s the biggest one i ve ever seen but if it s so damn big how the hell could it have fallen out so easily did capt howdy just leave it at the crime scene because he wanted to get caught they sure didn t make it seem like he did also they would never release capt howdy and i know that for a damn fact he would be in jail for the rest of his life and there s no getting around this much less let him return to his old house where he killed tortured everybody impossible and implausible br br and now the acting dear god did these people suck linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film she s poised and amazing too bad she hardly gets a good chance to act in this piece of crap amy smart shows up for about 10 minutes and then drops out of existence even the usually entertaining robert englund is underused and ineffective here dee snider plays the crazy guy with no talent whatsoever i never felt threatened scared or intimidated i d rather have seen dee snider in alexis arquette s role in bride of chucky it would have been so much more fun to see this talent less hack get it by that lovable psycho doll br br dee snider just plain sucks he can t act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he can t write did he write this damn movie in his sleep and he s obviously dumber than freaking jessica simpson this film is just a way for dee snider to show off all the weird crap he knows about self mutilation and modern primitives and blah blah blah either it s been done before or it just didn t need to be done i was bored throughout the whole damn thing br br the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller horror flick and it fails miserably it doesn t manage to scare shock or disturb in any shape way or form this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid br br strangeland gets a 0 out of 10 avoid at any and all costs not enjoyable in the slightest\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n
